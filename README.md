# SQL_portfolio_project

I found this Dataset on Kaggle and imported it into a Mysql database.
I then answered 5 business questions:

1. What days and times is the restaurant busiest.
2. How many pizzas are we selling on peak periods.
3. What are our best and worst selling pizzas.
4. WhatÂ´s our average order value.
5. How well are we using our seating capacity.
